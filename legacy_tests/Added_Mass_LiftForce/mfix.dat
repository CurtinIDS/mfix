! A 2D bubble-column fluidized bed simulation.  This is a 2D version
! of the case referred to below.

! This case is identical to that in the Added_Mass run directory but
! this version/directory includes modified momentum source files
! in order to incorporate a lift force in the x-direction only.

! For details see: Pfleger, D., Gomes, S., Gilbert, N., and Wagner,
! H.-G., "Hydrodynamic simulations of laboratory scale bubble 
! columns fundamental studies of the Eulerian-Eulerian modelling
! approach", Chem. Eng. Science, 54, (1999) pp. 5091-5099.
