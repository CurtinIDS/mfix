!  Purpose: This routine is called within the discrete phase time loop !
!  after the source terms have been calculated but before they are     !
!  applied. The user may insert code in this routine or call user      !
!  defined subroutines.                                                !

!  This routien is called from the time loop, but no indicies (fluid   !
!  cell or particle) are defined.                                      !
