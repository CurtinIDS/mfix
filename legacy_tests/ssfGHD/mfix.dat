! A 1D granular (i.e., no gas phase) dv/dx shear flow case in the
! absence of gravity that uses the Garzo, Hrenya & Dufty (2007) 
! polydisperse kinetic theory. Powder is a binary mixture so that
! mmax = 2

! In GHD momentum and granular temperature are solved for the mixture 
! and not for individual solids phases. Internally the code uses 
! mmax = 3, and smax represents the 'real' number of solids phase 
! (smax = 2).
